1)create a redshift cluster
  >create a role and attach policies(awss3 full acess and redshift full access)
  > attach the role to cluster

2) use dbeaverto connect redshift

   1)openinboundgateways for vpc

  >create a role with s3 fiull acess and glues service access policy
  >attach the role to it

4)Create Database and table in glue
   s3Path -> bucket that stored data

5)create a crawler and read data from s3 and store to table
